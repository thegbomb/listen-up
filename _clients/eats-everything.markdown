Bristol, England DJ and producer Eats Everything started out spinning jungle and drum'n'bass. Over the years, the man born Daniel Pearce incorporated more bass-loaded house into his repertoire, crafting a party-starting sound the likes of Carl Cox.

His non-stop party started in 2011 with his debut track, "Entrance Song" (Pets Records), a heartier and richer version of Disclosure's deep house. The Eats Everything EP followed on Dirtybird, and Pearce, preferring performing over studio time, continued with a series of consistent releases over the following years. A slew of honors helped move along his exposure, notably a few essential mixes for Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 show, as well as the DJ Mag award for Best British DJ in 2012. In addition to filling dancefloors, he also left his mark on works by Adam F, Jamie Jones, X-Press 2, Four Tet, Skream, Sinead Harnett, and Disclosure, as well as collaborating with Idiotproof, TEED, Justin Martin, and Catz Eats Dogz. In 2015, he received his second DJ Mag award for Best British DJ and dropped his debut mix album, the double-disc Fries with That? on Hypercolour. A second compilation arrived a year later, making Pearce the 86th deejay to craft a Fabric mix, which included a wide range of house and techno. He also released a pair of new songs, "Big Discs" b/w "Way Past Bedtime," designed in the same floor-filling fashion as his previous crowd-pleasers.
