Sweden's Axwell & Ingrosso are an electronic production duo featuring former Swedish House Mafia members Axwell (Sven Axel Christofer Hedfors) and Sébastian Ingrosso. Formed in 2014 after the breakup of Swedish House Mafia, Axwell & Ingrosso signed with Def Jam Records and made their live debut in June at the Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City. An appearance at the V Festival in England followed, as did performances in India. By late 2014 they had debuted two songs, "Can't Hold Us Down" and "Something New." The following year they delivered several more singles, including "On My Way," featuring vocalist Salem al Fakir, and "Sun Is Shining," the latter of which hit number one in Sweden.
