Norwegian dance act CLMD began as a duo of childhood friends Carl Louis and Martin Danielle. They made a splash in 2010 with "The Message," a track supported by the Rising Music label that was also charted by Axwell, one of the producers' inspirations. They crossed over with remixes of tracks by Bruno Mars ("Just the Way You Are") and Estelle ("Fall in Love"), released a 12" on Steve Angello's Size label, established a boutique label through Sony, and scored major hits with "Black Eyes and Blue" and "The Message," the latter of which went platinum several times over in Norway. In 2014, following the release of "Wild Men," Louis opted to leave in pursuit of a solo career. Danielle retained CLMD as an acronym for "Create Love, Music and Dreams" and continued to make high-spirited EDM with "Keep Dreaming," a 2015 single that featured a lead vocal from Jared Lee.
