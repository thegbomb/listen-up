London-based electronic dance producer Jonas Blue caught the attention of the industry with his reimagining of Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit "Fast Car." Adding a tropical house tint to the plaintive, bittersweet acoustic original, Blue enlisted the talents of young British singer Dakota, whose sultry vocals helped carry the song to the top of 17 international charts, including number one slots in Australia, Scotland, and both the U.K. and U.S. dance charts. In June 2016, Blue released the follow-up to his global smash, "Perfect Strangers," which featured JP Cooper on vocals.
