The man mysteriously known to most as Andy C. undoubtedly is one of the most important figures in drum'n'bass' evolution. He was there at the dawn of the '90s when drum'n'bass was still hardcore techno, honing his talents as a DJ. Then, in 1992, just as drum'n'bass was beginning to blossom, he formed Ram Records with Ant Miles. The label quickly became one of drum'n'bass' driving forces, releasing a plethora of 12" EPs featuring many of the genre's leading producers. As part of the duo Origin Unknown with Miles, Andy C. produced one of Ram's many landmark tracks, "Valley of the Shadows." Released in 1993, the track quickly became not only an anthem but also a classic, being remixed and re-released repeatedly. Later in the '90s came more Origin Unknown tracks; in addition, Andy C. joined forces with Shimon and Miles to form the much-celebrated supergroup Ram Trilogy. Throughout all his success, the man known to only a select few as Andy Clarke managed to remain for the most part anonymous and, as a result, considerably mythical -- an iconic figure within the insular and manic U.K. drum'n'bass scene -- known to even his fans as only Andy C.
