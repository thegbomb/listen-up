Having worked across a number of departments in his time at Listen Up, James gained a wealth of valuable experience during his first two years, undertaking roles at both National and Specialist Radio, Club and even Radio Syndication. After a further two years dedicated to working solely within our National Radio department, Jamesâ€™ work ethic, varied skill set and well-rounded approach thus made him a natural choice to take up his position as Head of National Radio.
