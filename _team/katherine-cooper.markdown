With over two years experience working in a University Law Library, Katherineâ€™s organisational skills, hands-on approach and keen eye for detail have proved vital to her accelerated development at Listen Up. Initially starting as an admin assistant, Katherine was quick to adapt to our fast-paced office environment and after playing a key administrative/organisational role in our recent office move, was the natural choice to take on her role as Office Manager.
