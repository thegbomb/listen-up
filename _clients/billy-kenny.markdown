British producer, DJ and engineer Billy Kenny is widely accustomed to the lower, more aggressive frequencies in the amalgamation between UK Garage, House and Techno. His hit track “Work” has reigned the bass heavy side of festivals ever since it’s release in August 2014 and continues to do so while more recent releases on Dirtybird, Sweat It Out and his co-run imprint “This Ain't Bristol” circulate the globe.
 
Hailing from Leeds, Billy now resides just across the channel in Germany although his sound still remains more Radio 1 than Berghain. This prolific writer now has to be seen as one of the most influential ambassadors in Germany for the sound he represents, despite the fact that over the last year he's been touring more than ever across four continents.
 
He and friends hold the reigns to their flourishing label This Ain't Bristol, which has turned more than a few well respected heads since it's launch in late 2014 and continues to pump out high quality releases to their ever-growing audience.
 
Unlike many producers on the circuit, Billy has perfected his craft behind the decks. His endless edits, live sampling, looping and unexpected choices of weaponry always make his unique set’s one to remember for those listening.
