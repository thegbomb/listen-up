New Yorker Dennis Ferrer has been moving and shaking in the dance music world since the mid-'90s, first making techno-flavored records with Damon Wild under the name Morph. But it wasn't until 2003 that Ferrer truly broke through. "Sandcastles," a track he made alongside Jerome Sydenham, became a worldwide dancefloor smash, giving him his first glimmers of recognition in the electronic music world at large. Further acclaimed tracks such as "Son of Raw" and "Church Lady," remixes for the likes of Blaze, Fish Go Deep, Martin Solveig, and Dido, and a number of mix albums only added to his growing profile. A good chunk of his original material over the years was compiled in 2006 on the album The World as I See It.
