In early 2015 they set up the LA office of the company where James runs all business endeavours. In James’ 16 years in the music industry his portfolio of covers, extended features and number 1 records is hard to beat. Prior to James and Luke partnering up in Listen Up he managed the world famous fabric in London’s online promotion and record label releases in all territories worldwide. James then set up the bespoke online promotions company Macked before partnering with Luke in Listen Up.
