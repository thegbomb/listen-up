Kicking his career off as a mash-up artist, Serbian-Australian producer Dragan Roganović has released many successful EDM productions and remixes under the moniker of Dirty South.

Born in Belgrade, Dragan moved with his family to Australia when he was 13. He first began making bootleg remixes of dance tracks with only a tape deck, a mixer, and a splicer at his disposal, but in 2004 he bought his first laptop computer and Dirty South was born. The Vicious Vinyl label would issue his debut single, "Sleazy," in 2005 while 2006 saw his remix of Evermore's "It's Too Late" top the Australian club charts. In 2008 his remix of Kaskade's "Sorry" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, while 2011 saw him nominated for the award again for his work on the Temper Trap's "Sweet Disposition." The compilation Strictly Dirty South was released in 2011 as well. In 2012 he released the "City of Dreams" single in collaboration with Swedish DJ Alesso, while 2013 saw him make his official debut with the album Speed of Life. His 2014 , With You, was influenced by indie pop and was accompanied by a 38-minute film, one directed by Roganović with songs from the album as its soundtrack.
