A South London-based commercial dance production team, Disciples consists of Nathan Duvall, Gavin Koolmon, and Luke McDermott. Duvall and Koolmon previously recorded under the aliases Stylistix ("How Soon") and Kool & Duvall ("U Lift Me Up"). The trio debuted in 2013 on the New State Music label with Remedy EP, the title track of which was played by BBC DJs Target and Trevor Nelson. Their profile increased after they signed to Pete Tong's Parlophone-supported FFRR label, where they issued 2014-2015 singles such as "Catwalk" and "They Don't Know," the latter of which went to number 24 on the U.K. pop chart. That success primed them for a couple major collaborations issued during the second half of 2015: "Yellow," with Robin Schulz, and "How Deep Is Your Love," made with songwriter/vocalist Ina Wroldsen and co-producer Calvin Harris. The latter song narrowly missed the top of the U.K. chart, reached the Top 30 of the U.S. Hot 100, and made major impressions in several other territories. By the end of the year, Disciples were promoting another release, The Following EP.
