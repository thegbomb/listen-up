Amsterdam's Sam Feldt earned attention in Europe and then worldwide for his melodic house remixes, mixtapes, and collaborations including 2014's "Bloesem" with De Hofnar and "Hot Skin" with Kav Verhouzer on Dutch label Spinnin' Records. After a series of live shows in Europe, which he built over time to contain mostly his own productions, he toured North America for the first time in early 2015. "Midnight Hearts" with the Him featuring ANG13 followed soon after, and that spring, Feldt signed with Universal Music for worldwide release of his song "Show Me Love" featuring English vocalist Kimberly Anne.
