Anjunabeats is the label owned and A&R’d by Above & Beyond - Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness and Paavo Siljamäki.
Starting its journey back in 2000 as an outlet for Above & Beyond’s own productions, the label soon grew to encompass an ever-growing family of global talent. Over our 14 years, Anjunabeats has helped kickstart the careers of Mat Zo, Arty, Andrew Bayer, Boom Jinx, Super 8 & Tab, Oliver Smith, Jaytech, ilan Bluestone and many more.

As well as the legendary Anjunabeats Volume series mixed by Above & Beyond, Anjunabeats has also released a number of treasured artist albums including Above & Beyond’s own classic "Group Therapy", Mat Zo’s eclectic "Damage Control" and Andrew Bayer’s experimental "If It Were You, We'd Never Leave". You will find information on all within our website. Have a good look around!

Over 300 releases bear the iconic Anjuna ‘A’. If you’d like to be part of the next chapter of the Anjuna story, send us your music. We can’t wait to hear it.
