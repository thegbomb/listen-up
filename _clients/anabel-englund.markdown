Although the L.A.-based singer/songwriter Anabel Englund eventually became most well-known for her vocal work with the house production quartet Hot Natured, in her late teens she pursued a different musical path. During 2010 and 2011 she wrote and performed delicate, sparsely arranged, piano-led ballads both on her own and as part of a duo named Suburban Nightlife. However, after she met the renowned Chicago DJ Lee Foss at one of his L.A. gigs, Englund was invited to contribute vocals to Foss & MK's Electricity EP. Issued on his and Jamie Jones' Hot Creations imprint in late 2012, the record signified the birth of Englund's career in house music. Live performances with fellow L.A. artists such as the Human Life production team, helped Englund to develop her stage persona, which increasingly betrayed a clear influence from the style and sound of her idol, Madonna. In July 2012, Dim Mak released the euphoric "In Time," her collaboration with Josh Anaya's Peace Treaty. By the following summer she had appeared on Hot Natured's tasteful '90s house throwback "Reverse Skydiving," a record that graced the U.K. singles chart.
