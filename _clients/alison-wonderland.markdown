With a sound as big as her name is punny, Alison Wonderland is a Sydney-based EDM producer and DJ who began her music career on the opposite side of the spectrum, as a classically trained cellist. She spent a few years DJ'ing before releasing her debut single, "Get Ready," in 2013; then in 2014 she signed with the EMI label and released the ironically titled Calm Down. The EP earned accolades from tastemakers like Annie Mac and Diplo, plus it featured the hit single "I Want U." A year later she released her debut album Run, which featured guest spots from Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, Lido, and Slumberjack. The DJ celebrated the release with a series of launch parties at different strip bars dotted across Australia.
