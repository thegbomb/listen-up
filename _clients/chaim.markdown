Tech-house producer Chaim (Chaim Avital) debuted in early 2007. By the end of the year, he had released nearly a dozen 12” singles, including co-productions with fellow Israeli Guy Gerber, and remixed roughly as many tracks -- a John Tejada-like rate of melodic output for labels like Supplement Facts, My Best Friend, Turbo, and Love Minus Zero. From 2008 through 2010, he was relatively low-key, but he settled in with Ellen Allien's esteemed Berlin-based Bpitch Control label, where he issued five singles as a prelude to 2011’s Alive, his debut album.
