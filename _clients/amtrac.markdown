Amtrac, real name Caleb Cornett, has been pushing his creative limits as a producer, DJ, musician and sometimes-vocalist since 2008. The multi-talented artist can electrify an audience, be it with a moving live music performance or by working dancefloors up to a sweat with his driving yet funk-filled DJ sets – it’s his mantra to be as diverse a DJ as possible, to connect with the crowd and to keep them moving at all costs.


Raised in Morehead, Kentucky on a diet of deep cuts by Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, Caleb was lured to the dance realm by crossover acts such as The Prodigy and Chemical Brothers. Both sets of influences show on his debut LP, Came Along (2010), a 13-track adventure awash in post-punk influences and indie dance charm. From there, he branched out even further with Hey There Kiddo (2012), an all-sample opus with deep disco roots inspired by one of his favorite albums of all time, Since I Met You by The Avalanches; and The Scheme EP (2012) explores underground deep house vibes with dark, funky rhythms. Recently he released singles “Those Days” featuring vocals from Stevie Wonder & Marvin Gaye on legendary UK dance label Toolroom Records. In 2016 came the release of the “Lost In Motion” EP, providing a snapshot of where Amtrac is at musically at the moment. The EP includes “Long Nights” which saw Cornett once again lay down his own vocals.

But as impressive as his original works may be, one can’t discuss Cornett’s body of work without mentioning what may well be the calling card of his career: the remix. An Amtrac remix has become a coveted commodity in today’s music business – from Majors like Interscope, Warner Bros & Sony to tastemaker labels like  Kitsune, Defected, and Ministry of Sound. 

Never content to settle, Amtrac’s musical mood and influences change with each passing season. His ambition and curiosity keep him locked on the edge, always happy to experiment with new techniques and sounds. His music is what he feels in the moment. Simply put, his constant evolution comes from a hatred of boredom and a love for his labor. It’s just not in his nature to stagnate.
